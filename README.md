Kicksend initiative believes that hackers are like magicians. For all the good and wrong reasons: Magicians Vanish, transform, levitate, penetrate and predicts things. They try to reverse others magicians tricks to understand how they work. The most complicated and obfuscated the better. The fun is guessing the mystery, the joy is making the impossible real. But more important: Magicians are weird. 

You see the relation now?. Legend tells of a wicked Kicksend’s intern that we’ll call “Spen”. When he went forth to his land, Spen left an unsolved mystery behind. He/She wrote a couple of tricks for Android controlled by an (unknown by then) magician device. Spen thought it was important to not comment the code and let other magicians, as you, (not to) understand it by your own. Because you can’t handle the truth. Kicksend’s initiative was created to understand this mysterious thing. Luckily, as the years went by we was able to know more about this device and we now have a name for that device: A magic binary wand. We could also find most of the trick’s code.
