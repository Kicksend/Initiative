Kicksend believes that hackers are like magicians. Magicians can vanish, transform, levitate, penetrate, and predict outcomes. To sharpen their skills, they examine the tricks of other magicians to understand how they work. The more complicated and obfuscated the trick, the better. The best part about figuring out a new trick is the process of unravelling the mystery surrounding it. The joy comes from making what was once impossible and inconcievable, perceptible and true. 

Legend tells of a wicked Kicksend intern named “Spen”. When (s)he went forth to his land, Spen left an unsolved mystery behind. (S)he wrote a couple of tricks for Android controlled by a magical device. Spen thought it was important to not comment the code to prevent other magicians (like you) to understand it on your own. The Kicksend Initiative was created in hopes of understanding this mysterious device left behind by Spen. Luckily, as the years went by, we were able to learn more about this device. We've been able to figure out that it is a magical "binary wand". Thankfully, we've also been able to recover some of the code left behind by Spen. It's up to you to uncover its mystery.

We want you to help the Initiative so that we can solve the mystery. You can enter into the Kicksend Initiative by dropping by <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/BnhrW">Kicksend's headquarters</a>. Don't worry, you don't have to talk with us if you don't want to. 

Levels
==========

The only thing you would want to check is LevelXX.java inside 'WebSocketServer/src/main/java/com/kicksend/'.


Compile and run
==========

I don't know why you would want to run the server, but just in case you are curious you can achieve that by doing:

```bash 
$ cd WebSocketServer
$ ant
$ java -cp build/classes WebServer
```
